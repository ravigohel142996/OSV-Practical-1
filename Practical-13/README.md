# Practical 13: File Organization

## Aim
To write a C program to simulate File Organization techniques:
- Single Level Directory
- Two Level Directory

## Theory
File organization refers to how files are arranged in a directory structure. Single level has all files in one directory, while two level separates files by user directories, providing better organization and isolation.

## Program Included
`file_organization.c` - File organization simulation

## Commands to Compile and Run
```bash
gcc file_organization.c -o file_organization
./file_organization
```

## Viva Questions
1. What is a directory?
2. What is single level directory structure?
3. What is two level directory structure?
4. What are the advantages of hierarchical directories?
5. What is a file system?
