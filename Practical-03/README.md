# Practical 3: Mathematical Operations and Result Generation

## Aim
To write shell scripts for:
a) Calculating simple interest
b) Checking if a number is Positive, Negative or Zero
c) Generating student marksheet for 3 subjects

## Programs Included
1. `simple_interest.sh` - Calculate simple interest
2. `number_check.sh` - Check number type
3. `marksheet.sh` - Generate student marksheet

## Commands to Run
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
./simple_interest.sh
./number_check.sh
./marksheet.sh
```

## Viva Questions
1. What is the formula for simple interest?
2. How do you perform floating-point arithmetic in bash?
3. What is bc command used for?
4. How do you calculate percentage in shell scripts?
