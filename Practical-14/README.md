# Practical 14: Disk Scheduling Algorithms

## Aim
To write a C program to simulate Disk Scheduling Algorithms:
- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)

## Theory
Disk scheduling algorithms determine the order in which disk I/O requests are serviced. The goal is to minimize seek time and improve overall disk performance.

## Program Included
`disk_scheduling.c` - Disk scheduling simulation

## Commands to Compile and Run
```bash
gcc disk_scheduling.c -o disk_scheduling
./disk_scheduling
```

## Viva Questions
1. What is disk scheduling?
2. What is seek time?
3. Explain FCFS disk scheduling
4. Explain SCAN (Elevator) algorithm
5. What is the difference between SCAN and C-SCAN?
