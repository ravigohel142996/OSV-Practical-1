# Practical 10: Dining Philosophers Problem

## Aim
To write a C program to simulate the Dining Philosophers problem

## Theory
The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem that illustrates:
- Resource sharing among multiple processes
- Deadlock prevention
- Five philosophers sit around a table with five chopsticks
- Each philosopher needs two chopsticks to eat

## Program Included
`dining_philosophers.c` - Dining Philosophers simulation

## Commands to Compile and Run
```bash
gcc dining_philosophers.c -o dining_philosophers
./dining_philosophers
```

## Viva Questions
1. What is the Dining Philosophers problem?
2. What is deadlock?
3. How can deadlock be prevented in this problem?
4. What is resource allocation?
5. What are the conditions for deadlock?
