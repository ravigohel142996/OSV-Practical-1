# Practical 11: Contiguous Memory Allocation

## Aim
To write a C program to simulate contiguous memory allocation techniques:
- First Fit
- Best Fit
- Worst Fit

## Theory
Contiguous memory allocation is a classical memory allocation model where each process is allocated a single contiguous block of memory. Different strategies exist for selecting which free partition to allocate to a process.

## Program Included
`memory_allocation.c` - Memory allocation simulation

## Commands to Compile and Run
```bash
gcc memory_allocation.c -o memory_allocation
./memory_allocation
```

## Viva Questions
1. What is memory allocation?
2. Explain First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit algorithms
3. What is fragmentation?
4. Which algorithm is fastest?
5. Which algorithm minimizes wasted space?
