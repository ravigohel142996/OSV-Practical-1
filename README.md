## 🚀 How to Run

### **Shell Scripts (Practicals 1-7)**

```bash
# Navigate to the practical folder
cd Practical-XX/

# Make script executable
chmod +x script_name.sh

# Run the script
./script_name.sh
```

### **C Programs (Practicals 8-14)**

## 📖 What Each Practical Contains

Each practical folder includes:

1. **README.md** - Overview, aims, and viva questions
2. **Source Code** - Fully documented with:
   - Aim
   - Algorithm
   - Program code
   - Sample input/output
   - Compilation/execution commands
   - Viva explanation

---

## 💡 Key Features

- ✅ **Complete Documentation** - Every program includes aim, algorithm, and viva notes
- ✅ **Well-Commented Code** - Easy to understand and learn
- ✅ **Sample I/O** - Example inputs and expected outputs provided
- ✅ **Ubuntu Compatible** - All programs tested on Ubuntu Linux
- ✅ **Lab Ready** - Ready for submission and viva examination

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing these practicals, students will learn:

- Shell scripting fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Process scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF)
- Process synchronization (Semaphores, Mutual Exclusion)
- Memory management (First/Best/Worst Fit)
- Virtual memory concepts (Page Replacement)
- File system organization
- Disk scheduling optimization

---

## 📝 Important Notes

- All shell scripts use **bash** interpreter
- C programs use **standard libraries only** (no advanced dependencies)
- Programs are designed to be **simple and viva-friendly**
- Each practical is **independent** and can be run separately

---

## 🔧 System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu Linux (18.04 or higher)
- **Shell:** Bash
- **Compiler:** GCC (for C programs)
- **Additional Tools:** bc (for floating-point arithmetic in shell scripts)

### Install Required Tools

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc bc
```
